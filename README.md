# Machine Learning Documentation

Welcome to my Machine Learning documentation repository. Here, I chronicle my journey and experiences as I delve into various aspects of machine learning, and focus on [computer vision](https://github.com/lakshay-nasa/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Computer%20Vision). In this section, I explore the fascinating world of computer vision through hands-on projects, where I apply and hone my skills.

#### Projects List:

- **[3D VisioGen](https://github.com/lakshay-nasa/VisioGen):** A transformative project where 2D images are used to generate 3D models. This project aims to bridge the gap between two-dimensional and three-dimensional visual representations.
  
- **[Access Control System](https://github.com/lakshay-nasa/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Computer%20Vision/Access%20Control%20System):** Leveraging facial recognition technologies, this system enhances security by ensuring that only authorized personnel can access secure areas.
  
- **[ScriptVista](https://github.com/lakshay-nasa/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Models/ScriptVista):** An innovative tool designed to convert handwritten scripts into editable text formats, streamlining the digitization process.
